This repository demonstrates a common yet frustrating issue with the Expo CLI: encountering generic error messages that hinder debugging.  The `expoBug.js` file simulates a scenario where such an error might occur.  The solution in `expoBugSolution.js` offers strategies to troubleshoot and resolve this problem. The focus is on improving debugging techniques and pinpointing the root cause of these vague errors.
