The solution involves a multi-pronged approach to debugging.  First, ensure that your project's dependencies are correctly defined in `package.json`. Then, run `expo prebuild` to check for issues with your project setup before a full build.  If problems persist, examine the logs produced by the Expo CLI carefully; even generic messages may contain hints. Consider using `expo diagnostics` to gather system information and identify possible conflicts.  Finally, clean and rebuild your project using `expo clean` and `expo start`. If you're still facing the issue, consult the Expo documentation and community forums for similar reported problems.
